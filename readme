an experimental 3d roguelike game written in c.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  technology used
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

3d rendering is done via raycasting. this is not the same as
ray tracing, in fact it is far more efficient, with severe
technical limitations in terms of what can be rendered. it was
pioneered by wolfenstien 3d, the first game (that i know of) to
use this rendering technique. basically the way it works is 
the map is a grid of either nothing (' ') or a wall ('#').
for example, consider this map:

+-----------+
|#####=#####|
|#         #|
|#  ##  @  #|
|###########|
+-----------+

(the |, -, and + outlines serve simply as a demonstration, they
are meaningless.)

the @ symbol represents the player character (in typical roguelike
fashion).

let's say the player is looking in the direction of the door ('='),
this would be rendered by casting a ray outwards from the players
position for each column of the view (terminal cell). once it
colides with some wall, the distance from the player is recorded,
and used to render a column of cells on the screen with an appropriate
height.

~~~~~~~~
  maps
~~~~~~~~

cog maps are stored as ascii encoded text files. they translate literally
to the map that will be rendered by cog. the diagram above demonstrating
rendering, is in fact, a valid map. large maps are split into "chunks" and
rendered in different map buffers (see map.h).

  +-----------+
  |  example  |
  +-----------+

  the following ascii could be copy and pasted into a map file
  (unindented), and it should work:

      ##################
  #####                #  #####
  #                    ####   #
  #                           #
  #            @              #
  #                           #
  #                           #
  #############################

  | chars |
  +-------+

  each character in a map means something, most of these are yet to be
  implemented, but here's what they will mean in the end:

  # wall
  @ player
  = door
  a-z teleport
  A-Z corresponding teleport exit 

~~~~~~~~~~~~
  building
~~~~~~~~~~~~

run make to build cog. by default it will also run the program.
the binary will be located in dist/cog.

  $ make

none so far. perhaps ncurses will be used later on, but i'm not
sure yet.
